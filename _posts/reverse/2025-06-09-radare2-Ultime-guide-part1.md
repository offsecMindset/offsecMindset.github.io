In this suite of articles, we will learn how to use radare2 for effective reverse engineering. <br>
So what is radare2 !? <br>

created by Pancake, Radare2 is a reverse engineering powerful framework. It is cross plateform tools. This mean that you can use it on linux/windows/macOS/Android.
Inlike other reverse engineering tool like IDA, Binary ninja, radare2 is open source and the core of it is a command line tools.
It is a powerfull reverse engineering framework which come with a lot of subtools which we will overview in this tutorial part.
Radare2 is powerful tool but the learn curve of it can be long. It can take time and effort/pratice to become confortable with it. But believe me, when you will be familiary with this tool, you will get a lot of powerful in your reverse engineering carrer.
<br>
If you are CTF Player especially REV challenges,  It will be very important for you to know Radare2. It will help you to solve crackmes  durant CTF competition.
`Radare2`  is not only made for CTF players. It is made also for real live vulnerabilities researchers (Reverse engineers, bug hunters, and so on).
So if you plan to make reverse engineering or vulnerabilities researche (binary side)  your carrer, it will be very important for you to master `Radare2`  skills.
This part will be a litte introduction of the tool.
<br> in the next chapters, we will deep dive into the internal work of the tools and use it to solve reverse engineering challenge.
Hope you enjoy this serie
